#### Description: Search for highlighted words on jumia
 This project is an extension which will search up selected words on jumia.com cutting out the process needed to open the site
and searching it up by yourself.
 In the manifest.json file, the context menu permission is granted so that the extension can popup upon any right clicks.
The eventpage.js file, the first part of the code creates a row for jumbot on the list of options whenyou right click.
while the other half pens up a taband searches up the highlighted word.

Some of the issues faced while working with javascript were:
 Familiarising myself with it while trying to avoid rookie mistakes in my code,
getting the right permissions to use on the search bar such that it wont be unnecesary ones that are loaded into it
such as storage instead of tabs and contextMenus, and making sure that the right url was used as it kept sliping my mind.
